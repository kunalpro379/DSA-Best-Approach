# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Repository

## Introduction

Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) repository! This repository is a comprehensive collection of implementations, explanations, and analyses of various data structures and algorithms.


## Data Structures

Data structures are specialized formats for organizing, processing, retrieving, and storing data. They are essential for designing efficient algorithms and solving complex problems. Below are the key data structures covered in this repository:

- **Arrays**: Fixed-size, contiguous memory structures for storing elements of the same type.
  - [Array Algorithms and Techniques](./ArraysAlgorithms/)
- **Linked Lists**: Dynamic structures consisting of nodes that point to the next element.
  - [Linked List Implementations and Problems](./LinkedLists/)
- **Stacks and Queues**: Abstract data types for LIFO (Last In, First Out) and FIFO (First In, First Out) operations.
  - Coming Soon!
- **Trees**: Hierarchical structures including Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, and more.
  - Coming Soon!
- **Graphs**: Collections of nodes connected by edges, used for modeling relationships.
  - [Graph Algorithms and Topological Sorting](./TopologicalSorting/)
- **Hash Tables**: Key-value pair structures for efficient data retrieval.
  - Coming Soon!
- **Heaps**: Specialized tree-based structures for priority queue operations.
  - Coming Soon!
